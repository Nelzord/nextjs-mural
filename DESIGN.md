  - Early error detection
  - Improved maintainability

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Application Structure
```
app/
├── api/                    # API routes
│   ├── mural-pay/         # Mural Pay API endpoints
│   └── ai-analysis/       # AI Analysis endpoints
├── components/            # Reusable components
├── config/               # Configuration files
├── accounts/            # Account management pages
├── payouts/             # Payout management pages
